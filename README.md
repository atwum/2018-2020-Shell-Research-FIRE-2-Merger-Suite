# 2018-2020-Shell-Research-FIRE-2-Merger-Suite
Repository for a project on the incidence and formation of shells in merging galaxies. 

The FIRE 2 Merger Suite is a collection of 24 high resolution, hydrodynamic, parsec-scale, binary  simulations that effectively model the physics of two similarly massed gas-rich galaxies ( mass ratio 1:2.5) as the intereact ideally and merge. Shells are a class of faint tidal features that form as a result of the merger event. Shells like other tidal features like streams and plumes, act as tracers of the infalling galaxy and appear as faint sharp concentric arcs made entirely of stellar matter surrounding the resultant galaxy spanning great distances. Shells unlike other todal features remain visble millions of years after the merger, and observationally, serve as markers of recent mergers. 

Using a fiducial run from the suite of simulations, I develop a script that identifies, and isolates the stars within the shells, in an attempt to study the origin, formation and evolution of these structures.
